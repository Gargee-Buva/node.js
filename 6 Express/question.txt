ðŸ“¦In Web Development:
Routing defines:

What should happen when the user visits /

What should happen when the user visits /about

What should happen when the user submits a form to /contact

ðŸ”‘ Key Points:
app.get(path, callback) â†’ Handles GET requests

app.post(path, callback) â†’ Handles POST requests

Each route is like a rule for what the server should do when it gets a certain request
