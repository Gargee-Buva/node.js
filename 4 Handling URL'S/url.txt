üßæ Purpose:
To create a simple HTTP server using Node.js that:

Logs incoming requests with timestamps.

Serves basic routes (/ and /about).

Responds with appropriate content based on the request.

Stores logs in a file.

üì¶ Modules Used:
http: To create the server.

fs: To handle file system operations (like appending logs).

url: To parse the request URL and query parameters.

‚öôÔ∏è Core Functionality:
Server Creation:

Uses http.createServer() to build the server.

Handles requests with a callback function receiving req and res.

Logging Requests:

For every request, logs the current timestamp and URL.

Appends this info to a file named log.txt using fs.appendFile.

Routing Logic:

If the path is /, responds with "home page".

If the path is /about, responds with "Hi, {username}", where username is extracted from the query string (e.g., /about?myname=Gargee).

Any other path returns "404 Not found".

Server Listening:

The server listens on port 8000.

Logs "Server Started !" to the console when it begins.

‚úÖ URL Query Parameters ‚Äì In Short:
What are they?
Query parameters are key-value pairs added to a URL after a ?, used to pass data to the server.

Format:

/path?key1=value1&key2=value2
Example:


/about?myname=Gargee
Here, myname is the key and Gargee is the value.

Why are they used?

To send data from the client (browser) to the server.

Commonly used for:

Searching (?q=flowers)

Filtering (?category=books&sort=price)

Customizing responses (like greeting a user by name).
