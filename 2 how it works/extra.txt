1. Encoding converts information into specific formats (e.g., binary, URL, UTF-8) to ensure compatibility across different systems, 
   enable efficient storage, and facilitate secure transmission.
2. A non-blocking request provides a result asynchronously without blocking other tasks through a callback.

Node.js Architecture :-
1. Client Request
A client sends a request to the Node.js server.
This request enters the Node.js runtime.

2. Event Queue
All incoming requests are placed into the Event Queue.
The event queue stores callbacks for operations that are ready to be executed.

3. Event Loop (Core of Node.js)
The Event Loop continuously monitors the event queue.
It checks whether the call stack is free.
If free, it picks the next event from the queue and executes it.
This loop runs continuously, which is why it is called an event loop.

4. Blocking Operations
Blocking operations are tasks that take time to complete (e.g. file system access, database queries).
These operations are offloaded to background threads or the system kernel.
Node.js does not wait for these operations to finish.

Examples:
File I/O
Network calls
Database queries

5. Non-Blocking Operations
Non-blocking operations execute immediately.
They do not stop the event loop.
Once completed, their callbacks are pushed back into the event queue.

6. Processing and Response
When the background task finishes, its callback is added to the event queue.
The event loop picks it up and processes it.
Finally, the response is sent back to the client
